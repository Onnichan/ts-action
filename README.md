### What is it?

`ts-action` is a package for declaring Redux action creators with less TypeScript cruft.

### Why might you need it?

I wanted a mechanism for declaring and consuming actions that involved writing as little boilerplate as possible. If you, too, want less cruft, you might find this package useful.

Also, if you are using NgRx or redux-observable, you might find the [`ts-action-operators`](https://github.com/cartant/ts-action-operators) package useful, too.

For an in-depth look at TypeScript, Redux and `ts-action`, have a look at: [How to Reduce Action Boilerplate](https://blog.angularindepth.com/how-to-reduce-action-boilerplate-90dc3d389e2b).

## Install

Install the package using npm:

```
npm install ts-action --save-dev
```

TypeScript version 2.6 or later is required.

## Usage

Action creators are declared using the `action` method:

```ts
import { action } from "ts-action";
const Foo = action("FOO");
```

Actions are created using the action creator as a class:

```ts
store.dispatch(new Foo());
```

Although the actions are created as class instances, internally, the `prototype` is reset, so they are compatible with `reactjs/redux`, as they are considered to be plain objects.

For actions with payloads, the payload type is specified using the [`payload`](#payload) method:

```ts
import { action, payload } from "ts-action";
const Foo = action("FOO", payload<{ foo: number }>());
```

and the payload value is specified when creating the action:

```ts
store.dispatch(new Foo({ foo: 42 }));
```

To have the properties added to the action itself - rather than a `payload` property - use the [`props`](#props) method instead. Or, for more control over the parameters accepted by the constructor, use the [`base`](#base) method.

Action creators have a `type` property that can be used to narrow an action's TypeScript type in a reducer.

The action types can be combined into a discriminated union and the action can be narrowed to a specific TypeScript type using a `switch` statement, like this:

```ts
import { action, payload, union } from "ts-action";

const Foo = action("FOO", payload<{ foo: number }>());
const Bar = action("BAR", payload<{ bar: number }>());
const All = union(Foo, Bar);

interface State { foo?: number; bar?: number; }
const initialState = {};

function fooBarReducer(state: State = initialState, action: typeof All): State {
  switch (action.type) {
  case Foo.type:
    return { ...state, foo: action.payload.foo };
  case Bar.type:
    return { ...state, bar: action.payload.bar };
  default:
    return state;
  }
}
```

Or, the package's `isType` method can be used to narrow the action's type using `if` statements, like this:

```ts
import { action, isType, payload } from "ts-action";

const Foo = action("FOO", payload<{ foo: number }>());
const Bar = action("BAR", payload<{ bar: number }>());

interface State { foo?: number; bar?: number; }
const initialState = {};

function fooBarReducer(state: State = initialState, action: Action): State {
  if (isType(action, Foo)) {
    return { ...state, foo: action.payload.foo };
  }
  if (isType(action, Bar)) {
    return { ...state, bar: action.payload.bar };
  }
  return state;
}
```

Or, the package's [`reducer`](#reducer) method can be used to create a reducer function, like this:

```ts
import { action, on, payload, reducer } from "ts-action";

const Foo = action("FOO", payload<{ foo: number }>());
const Bar = action("BAR", payload<{ bar: number }>());

interface State { foo?: number; bar?: number; }
const initialState = {};

const fooBarReducer = reducer<State>([
  on(Foo, (state, { payload }) => ({ ...state, foo: payload.foo })),
  on(Bar, (state, { payload }) => ({ ...state, bar: payload.bar }))
], initialState);
```

### action

```ts
function action<T, C extends Ctor<{}>>(type: T, options?: { BaseCtor: C })
```

The `action` method returns an action creator. Action creators are classes and actions are be created using `new`:

```ts
const Foo = action("FOO");
const foo = new Foo();
console.log(foo); // { type: "FOO" }
```

The `type` argument passed to `action` must be a string literal or have a string-literal type. Otherwise, TypeScript will not be able to narrow actions in a discriminated union.

The `type` option passed to the `action` method can be obtained using the creator's static `type` property:

```ts
switch (action.type) {
case Foo.type:
  return { ...state, foo: action.payload.foo };
default:
  return state;
}
```

To define propeties, the `action` method can be passed options. The options should be created using the `empty`, `payload`, `props` or `base` methods.

<a name="empty"></a>

### empty

```ts
function empty()
```

The `empty` method constructs options for the `action` method. To declare an action without a payload or properties , call it like this:

```ts
const Foo = action("FOO", empty());
const foo = new Foo();
console.log(foo); // { type: "FOO" }
```

Actions default to being empty; if only a `type` is passed to the `action` call, an empty action is created by default:

```ts
const Foo = action("FOO");
const foo = new Foo();
console.log(foo); // { type: "FOO" }
```

<a name="payload"></a>

### payload

```ts
function payload<T>()
```

The `payload` method constructs options for the `action` method. To declare action properties within a `payload` property, call it like this:

```ts
const Foo = action("FOO", payload<{ name: string }>());
const foo = new Foo({ name: "alice" });
console.log(foo); // { type: "FOO", payload: { name: "alice" } }
```

<a name="props"></a>

### props

```ts
function props<T>()
```

The `props` method constructs options for the `action` method. To declare action properties at the same level as the `type` property, call it like this:

```ts
const Foo = action("FOO", props<{ name: string }>());
const foo = new Foo({ name: "alice" });
console.log(foo); // { type: "FOO", name: "alice" }
```

The `props` method is similar to the `payload` method, but with `props`, the specified properties are added to the action itself - rather than a `payload` property.

<a name="base"></a>

### base

```ts
function base<C extends Ctor<{}>>(BaseCtor: C)
```

The `base` method constructs options for the `action` method. To declare a base class with properties, call it like this:

```ts
const Foo = action("FOO", base(class { constructor(public name: string) {} }));
const foo = new Foo("alice");
console.log(foo); // { type: "FOO", name: "alice" }
```

The `base` method offers more control over property defaults, etc. as the base class is declared inline.

<a name="union"></a>

### union

The `union` method can be used to infer a union of actions - for type narrowing using a discriminated union. It's passed two or more action creators and returns a value that can be used with TypeScript's `typeof` operator, like this:

```ts
const All = union(Foo, Bar);
function reducer(state: any = [], action: typeof All): any {
  switch (action.type) {
  case Foo.type:
    return ... // Here the action will be narrowed to Foo.
  case Bar.type:
    return ... // Here the action will be narrowed to Bar.
  default:
    return state;
  }
}
```

<a name="isType"></a>

### isType

`isType` is a TypeScript [type guard](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/advanced-types.html) that will return either `true` or `false` depending upon whether the passed action is of the appropriate type. TypeScript will narrow the type when used with an `if` statement.

For example:

```ts
if (isType(action, Foo)) {
  // Here, TypeScript has narrowed the type, so the action is strongly typed
  // and individual properties can be accessed in a type-safe manner.
}
```

And:

```ts
if (isType(action, Foo, Bar)) {
  // Here, TypeScript has narrowed the type to `typeof union(Foo, Bar)`.
}
```

### guard

`guard` is a higher-order equivalent of `isType`. That is, it returns a TypeScript [type guard](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/advanced-types.html) that will, in turn, return either `true` or `false` depending upon whether the passed action is of the appropriate type. The `guard` method is useful when dealing with APIs that accept type guards.

For example, `Array.prototype.filter` accepts a type guard:

```ts
const actions = [new Foo(), new Bar()];
const filtered = actions.filter(guard(Foo)); // Inferred to be: const filtered: Foo[]
```

<a name="reducer"></a>

### reducer

```ts
function reducer<S>(
  ons: { reducer: Reducer<S>, type: string }[],
  initialState: S
): Reducer<S>;
```

The `reducer` method creates a reducer function out of the combined, action-specific reducers specified in the array.

<a name="on"></a>

### on

```ts
function on<T extends string, A extends Action<string>, S>(
  creator: ActionCreator<T, A>,
  reducer: (state: S, action: A) => S
): { reducer: Reducer<S>, type: string };
```

The `on` method creates a reducer for a specific, narrowed action and returns an object - containing the created reducer and the action's type - that can be passed to the `reducer` method.
